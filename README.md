# airline-booking-project
This project aims to build a predictive model for airline passenger booking data, focusing on predicting whether a booking is complete or not based on various features such as the number of passengers, sales channel, trip type, purchase lead time, length of stay, flight hour, flight day, route, booking origin, and passenger preferences like extra baggage, preferred seat, and in-flight meals.
